Mysterious Singularity Numbers

## Descripción del Kata realizado:
This is a rather simple but interesting kata. Try to solve it using logic. The shortest solution can be fit into one line.


## Task
The point is that a natural number N (1 <= N <= 10^9) is given. You need to write a function which finds the number of natural numbers not exceeding N and not divided by any of the numbers [2, 3, 5].

___
### Example
Let's take the number 5 as an example:
1. 1 - doesn't divide integer by 2, 3, and 5
2. 2 - divides integer by 2
3. 3 - divides integer by 3
4. 4 - divides integer by 2
5. 5 - divides integer by 5

Answer: 1

because only one number doesn't divide integer by any of 2, 3, 5
___

### Note

_Again, try to think of a formula that will shorten your solution and help you pass big tests._

Good luck :)
